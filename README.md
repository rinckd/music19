`music19` -- Slim-downed version of music 21: A Toolkit for Computer-Aided Musical Analysis and 
Computational Musicology

Copyright Â© 2006-2025 [Michael Scott Asato Cuthbert](http://www.trecento.com)

`Music19` runs on Python 3.10+.

Released under the BSD (3-clause) license. See LICENSE.
Externally provided software (including the MIT-licensed Lilypond/MusicXML test Suite) and
music encoding in the corpus may have different licenses and/or copyrights. 
A no-corpus version of `music21` is available also on GitHub for those needing strict
BSD-license of all parts of the system.


### Testing 
  For everyday development testing:
  * Run specific test files in parallel (fastest for development)
  python -m pytest tests/unit/test_base.py tests/unit/test_stream.py -n auto -x

  * Run all unit tests in parallel with short traceback
  python -m pytest tests/unit/ -n auto --tb=short -x

  For comprehensive testing:
  * Run all tests with full output
  python -m pytest tests/unit/ -n auto -v

  * Run with coverage if needed
  python -m pytest tests/unit/ -n auto --cov=music21

  Key options:
  - -n auto: Auto-detect CPU cores
  - -n 8: Use 8 workers specifically
  - -x: Stop on first failure
  - --tb=short: Shorter tracebacks
  - -v: Verbose output
  - -q: Quiet output
