'''
This module describes classes for performing windowed and overlapping windowed analysis.
The :class:`music21.analysis.windowed.WindowedAnalysis` provides a reusable framework for
systematic overlapping window analysis at the starting at the level of the quarter note
and moving to the size of an entire :class:`music21.stream.Stream`.

Modular analysis procedures inherit from :class:`music21.analysis.discrete.DiscreteAnalysis`.
The :class:`music21.analysis.discrete.KrumhanslSchmuckler` (for algorithmic key detection)
and :class:`music21.analysis.discrete.Ambitus` (for pitch range analysis) classes provide examples.

    Create a WindowedAnalysis object.

    The provided `analysisProcessor` must provide a `process()` method that,
    when given a windowed Stream (a Measure) returns two element tuple containing
    (a) a data value (implementation dependent) and (b) a color code.

    def getMinimumWindowStream(self, timeSignature='1/4'):

        Take the loaded stream and restructure it into measures of 1 quarter note duration.

        >>> s = corpus.parse('bach/bwv324')
        >>> p = analysis.discrete.Ambitus()

        Placing one part into analysis:

        >>> wa = analysis.windowed.WindowedAnalysis(s.parts[0], p)

        >>> post = wa.getMinimumWindowStream()

        Placing a score with parts into analysis will automatically flatten
        the stream.  So these two calls are equivalent:

    def analyze(self, windowSize, windowType='overlap'):
        '''
        Calls, for a given window size, an analysis method across all windows in the source Stream.

        If windowType is "overlap", windows above size 1 are always overlapped, so if a window
        of size 2 is used, windows 1-2, then 2-3, then 3-4 are compared. If a window of size 3
        is used, windows 1-3, then 2-4, then 3-5 are compared.

        Windows are assumed to be partitioned by :class:`music21.stream.Measure` objects.

        Returns two lists for results, each equal in size to the length of minimum windows
        minus the window size plus one. If we have 20 1/4 windows, then the results lists
        will be of length 20 for window size 1, 19 for window size 2, 18 for window size 3, etc.

        The `minWindow` and `maxWindow` set the range of window sizes in quarter lengths.
        The `windowStepSize` parameter determines the increment between these window sizes,
        in quarter lengths.

        If `minWindow` or `maxWindow` is None, the largest window size available will be set.

        If `includeTotalWindow` is True, the largest window size will always be added.
