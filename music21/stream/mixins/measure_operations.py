    Mixin providing measure-related operations for Stream objects.
    
    This mixin contains methods for:
    - Measure access and retrieval (measures, measure)
    - Measure numbering and mapping (measureOffsetMap, _fixMeasureNumbers) 
    - Measure creation (makeMeasures)
    - Barline management (_getFinalBarline, _setFinalBarline)
    - Beat and measure calculations (beatAndMeasureFromOffset)
    - Measure detection (hasMeasures)
    
    Extracted from stream/base.py to improve code organization.
    Methods total: ~2,187 lines from original base.py
    
    These operations are fundamental to measure-based music analysis and
    manipulation, providing ways to access, create, and modify measures
    within musical scores.

        '''
        Get a region of Measures based on a start and end Measure number
        where the boundary numbers are both included.

        That is, a request for measures 4 through 10 will return 7 Measures, numbers 4 through 10.

        Additionally, any number of associated classes can be gathered from the context
        and put into the measure.  By default, we collect the Clef, TimeSignature, KeySignature,
        and Instrument so that there is enough context to perform.  (See getContextByClass()
        and .previous() for definitions of the context)

        While all elements in the source are the original elements in the extracted region,
        new Measure objects are created and returned.

        >>> bachIn = corpus.parse('bach/bwv66.6')
        >>> bachExcerpt = bachIn.parts[0].measures(1, 3)
        >>> len(bachExcerpt.getElementsByClass(stream.Measure))
        3

        Because bwv66.6 has a pickup measure, and we requested to start at measure 1,
        this is NOT true:

        >>> firstExcerptMeasure = bachExcerpt.getElementsByClass(stream.Measure).first()
        >>> firstBachMeasure = bachIn.parts[0].getElementsByClass(stream.Measure).first()
        >>> firstExcerptMeasure is firstBachMeasure
        False
        >>> firstBachMeasure.number
        0
        >>> firstExcerptMeasure.number
        1

        To get all measures from the beginning, go ahead and always request measure 0 to x,
        there will be no error if there is not a pickup measure.

        >>> bachExcerpt = bachIn.parts[0].measures(0, 3)
        >>> excerptNote = bachExcerpt.getElementsByClass(stream.Measure).first().notes.first()
        >>> originalNote = bachIn.parts[0].recurse().notes[0]
        >>> excerptNote is originalNote
        True

        if `indicesNotNumbers` is True, then it ignores defined measureNumbers and
        uses 0-indexed measure objects and half-open range.  For instance, if you have a piece
        that goes "m1, m2, m3, m4, ..." (like a standard piece without pickups, then
        `.measures(1, 3, indicesNotNumbers=True)` would return measures 2 and 3, because
        it is interpreted as the slice from object with index 1, which is measure 2 (m1 has
        an index of 0) up to but NOT including the object with index 3, which is measure 4.
        IndicesNotNumbers is like a Python-slice.

        >>> bachExcerpt2 = bachIn.parts[0].measures(0, 2, indicesNotNumbers=True)
        >>> for m in bachExcerpt2.getElementsByClass(stream.Measure):
        ...     print(m)
        ...     print(m.number)
        <music21.stream.Measure 0 offset=0.0>
        0
        <music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=1.0>
        1

        If `numberEnd=None` then it is interpreted as the last measure of the stream:

        >>> bachExcerpt3 = bachIn.parts[0].measures(7, None)
        >>> for m in bachExcerpt3.getElementsByClass(stream.Measure):
        ...     print(m)
        <music21.stream.Measure 7 offset=0.0>
        <music21.stream.Measure 8 offset=4.0>
        <music21.stream.Measure 9 offset=8.0>

        Note that the offsets in the new stream are shifted so that the first measure
        in the excerpt begins at 0.0

        The measure elements are the same objects as the original:

        >>> lastExcerptMeasure = bachExcerpt3.getElementsByClass(stream.Measure).last()
        >>> lastOriginalMeasure = bachIn.parts[0].getElementsByClass(stream.Measure).last()
        >>> lastExcerptMeasure is lastOriginalMeasure
        True

        At the beginning of the Stream returned, before the measures will be some additional
        objects so that the context is properly preserved:

        >>> for thing in bachExcerpt3:
        ...     print(thing)
        P1: Soprano: Instrument 1
        <music21.clef.TrebleClef>
        f# minor
        <music21.meter.TimeSignature 4/4>
        <music21.stream.Measure 7 offset=0.0>
        <music21.stream.Measure 8 offset=4.0>
        <music21.stream.Measure 9 offset=8.0>

        Collecting gets the most recent element in the context of the stream:

        >>> bachIn.parts[0].insert(10, key.Key('D-'))
        >>> bachExcerpt4 = bachIn.parts[0].measures(7, None)
        >>> for thing in bachExcerpt4:
        ...     print(thing)
        P1: Soprano: Instrument 1
        <music21.clef.TrebleClef>
        D- major
        ...

        What is collected is determined by the "collect" iterable.  To collect nothing
        send an empty list:

        >>> bachExcerpt5 = bachIn.parts[0].measures(8, None, collect=[])
        >>> for thing in bachExcerpt5:
        ...     print(thing)
        <music21.stream.Measure 8 offset=0.0>
        <music21.stream.Measure 9 offset=4.0>

        If a stream has measure suffixes, then Streams having that suffix or no suffix
        are returned.

        >>> p = stream.Part()
        >>> mSuffix3 = stream.Measure(number=3)
        >>> mSuffix4 = stream.Measure(number=4)
        >>> mSuffix4a = stream.Measure(number=4)
        >>> mSuffix4a.numberSuffix = 'a'
        >>> mSuffix4b = stream.Measure(number=4)
        >>> mSuffix4b.numberSuffix = 'b'
        >>> mSuffix5 = stream.Measure(number=5)
        >>> mSuffix5a = stream.Measure(number=5)
        >>> mSuffix5a.numberSuffix = 'a'
        >>> mSuffix6 = stream.Measure(number=6)
        >>> p.append([mSuffix3, mSuffix4, mSuffix4a, mSuffix4b, mSuffix5, mSuffix5a, mSuffix6])
        >>> suffixExcerpt = p.measures('4b', 6)
        >>> suffixExcerpt.show('text')
        {0.0} <music21.stream.Measure 4 offset=0.0>
        <BLANKLINE>
        {0.0} <music21.stream.Measure 4b offset=0.0>
        <BLANKLINE>

        <BLANKLINE>
        >>> suffixExcerpt2 = p.measures(3, '4a')
        >>> suffixExcerpt2.show('text')
        {0.0} <music21.stream.Measure 3 offset=0.0>
        <BLANKLINE>

        GatherSpanners can change the output:

        >>> from music21.common.enums import GatherSpanners
        >>> beachIn = corpus.parse('beach')
        >>> beachExcerpt = beachIn.measures(3, 4, gatherSpanners=GatherSpanners.ALL)
        >>> len(beachExcerpt.spannerBundle)
        8
        >>> len(beachIn.spannerBundle)
        94

        * Changed in v7: does not create measures automatically.
        * Changed in v7: If `gatherSpanners` is True or GatherSpanners.ALL (default),
          then just the spanners pertaining to the requested measure region
          are provided, rather than the entire bundle from the source.

        OMIT_FROM_DOCS

        and whose values are a list of references
        to the :class:`~music21.stream.Measure` objects that start
        at that offset.

        Even in normal music there may be more than
        one Measure starting at each offset because each
        :class:`~music21.stream.Part` might define its own Measure.
        However, you are unlikely to encounter such things unless you
        run Score.flatten(retainContainers=True).

        The offsets are always measured relative to the
        calling Stream (self).

        You can specify a `classFilterList` argument as a list of classes
        to find instead of Measures.  But the default will of course
        find Measure objects.

        Example 1: This Bach chorale is in 4/4 without a pickup, so
        as expected, measures are found every 4 offsets, until the
        weird recitation in m. 7 which in our edition lasts 10 beats
        and thus causes a gap in measureOffsetMap from 24.0 to 34.0.

        altoMeasures is a dictionary of the measures
        that are found in the alto part, so we can get
        the measure beginning on offset 4.0 (measure 2)
        and display it (though it's the only measure
        found at offset 4.0, there might be others as
        in example 2, so we need to call altoMeasures[4.0][0]
        to get this measure.):

        >>> altoMeasures[4.0]
        [<music21.stream.Measure 2 offset=4.0>]
        >>> altoMeasures[4.0][0].show('text')

        Example 2: How to get all the measures from all parts (not the
        most efficient way, but it works!):

        >>> mom = chorale.measureOffsetMap()
        >>> mom
        OrderedDict([(0.0, [<music21.stream.Measure 1 offset=0.0>,
