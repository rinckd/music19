class Part(Stream):
    '''
    A Stream subclass for designating music that is considered a single part.

    When put into a Score object, Part objects are all collected in the `Score.parts`
    call.  Otherwise, they mostly work like generic Streams.

    Generally the hierarchy goes: Score > Part > Measure > Voice, but you are not
    required to stick to this.

    Part groupings (piano braces, etc.) are found in the :ref:`moduleLayout` module
    in the :class:`~music21.layout.StaffGroup` Spanner object.

    OMIT_FROM_DOCS
    Check that this is True and works for everything before suggesting that it works!

    May be enclosed in a staff (for instance, 2nd and 3rd trombone
    on a single staff), may enclose staves (piano treble and piano bass),
    or may not enclose or be enclosed by a staff (in which case, it
    assumes that this part fits on one staff and shares it with no other
    part

        It can be set explicitly (or set on parsing) or it
        can take its name from the first :class:`~music21.instrument.Instrument` object
        encountered in the stream (or within a substream),
        first checking its .partName, then checking its .instrumentName

        Note that changing an instrument's .partName or .instrumentName while it
        is already in the Stream will not automatically update this unless
        .coreElementsChanged() is called or this Stream's elements are otherwise altered.
        This is because the value is cached so that O(n) searches through the Stream
        do not need to be done every time.

#     music that is performed by a single performer (see, for instance
#     the Piano doubling Celesta part in Lukas Foss's Time Cycle).  The
