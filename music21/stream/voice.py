'''
Voice class for music21 streams.

Extracted from stream/base.py as part of Phase 2 dependency reduction.

# PHASE 2 NOTE: This creates a circular import (voice.py -> base.py -> voice.py)
# This will be resolved in Phase 3 through dependency injection/factory patterns
# For now, we accept this circular import to maintain functionality

class Voice(Stream):
    '''
    A Stream subclass for declaring that all the music in the
    stream belongs to a certain "voice" for analysis or display
    purposes.

    Note that both Finale's Layers and Voices as concepts are
    considered Voices here.

    Voices have a sort order of 1 greater than time signatures
